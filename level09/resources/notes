`level09` has SUID bit set, it can be run as `flag09`. it takes an argument and encrypt it.

The encryption goes as follow; the index of each character is added to its ascii number, the character that has the resulting ascii number is the cipher.

a program to reverse this procedure was created: `flag.c`.

`flag.c` takes `token` file as argument and outputs the cleartext which is `flag09`'s password: f3iji1ju5yuevaus41q1afiuq

```
gcc flag.c -o flag && ./flag token
```

The following command gives the flag

```
su flag09 -c getflag
```
